Example of running code: 

python3 network_draft_code.py chlamyNET.gml all_muts_geneIDs.txt 100

Explanation:
Randomly selected the same number of nodes that sample_mutated_nodes.txt had 100 times
--> output: all randomly selected nodes had a greater distance compared to the mutated ones 
--> 100 iterations took ~1.5 hours
-->now running 1000 iterations 

In progress:
-optional argument of list of nodes for subgraph (ex. compare salt to dark)
